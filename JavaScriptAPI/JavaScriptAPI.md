## 1 Relevance between Web APIs and JS basic

- ![1-1](\img\1-1.png)

- JS basic
  - basic syntax stipulated by ECMAScript standard.
  - Can't do interactivity.
- Web APIs
  - stipulated by W3C.
  - Mainly learn DOM and BOM. 

Web APIs is one of the apply of JS. Realize interactivity by JS basic.

## 2 API and Web API

### 2.1 API

API (Application Programming Interface, 应用程序编程接口), defined a number of functions in advance.

> In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), an **application programming interface** (**API**) is an [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)) that defines interactions between multiple [software applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_application) or mixed [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware)-software intermediaries.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API#cite_note-1) It defines the kinds of [calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call) or requests that can be made, how to make them, the [data formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API#cite_note-Fisher1-2) An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed based on an industry-standard to ensure [interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability). Through [information hiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding), APIs enable [modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation.

Programmer could realize some functions by API, without learning how did it.

### 2.2 Web API

Web API is the API provided by browser to operate browser or elements on Web page. such as BOM, DOM.
